## Short Bio

  My name is Eric. I like solving tasks about computer programming, and I also join many coding camps to improve my skills. I've learned a lot from those experiences, and I really enjoy it. I love English, too. Practicing English listening, reading, speaking, and writing can make my English skills become better. In a nutshell, I've studied coding and English since I was a senior high school student. I enjoy learning, and I will continue learning these knowledge.
